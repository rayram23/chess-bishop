chess-bishop
============
This repo provides a basic project as a quick interview question.  
The goal of this project is to implement the _getNextPositions(...)_ method of the Bishop class.  Given a starting
position, that should return the set of positions that the Bishop could move to.

Clearly there is a lot left out of this question (like, other pieces on the board!), but this should serve as a
decent starting point.
